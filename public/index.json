	"content": "Serverless Student Management System Cloud-based serverless student management system for students and small businesses Cloud-based serverless student management system for students and small businesses 1. Executive Summary The Serverless Student Management System is a student management platform built on AWS Serverless Architecture, simulating a simple data management system for educational institutions and small businesses. The system automates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) processes for student information, utilizing services such as API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, Cognito, S3, Amplify, and CloudWatch. It adds real-time chat features using AWS AppSync, student diligence ranking with AWS Personalize, automated notifications via AWS SES, and exam event processing (such as updating test scores, exam schedules) through Amazon EventBridge to trigger automation.\nKey Benefits:\nStudents: Learn and practice real-world cloud application development, communicate directly with teachers, receive ranking notifications. Small Businesses: Low-cost, easy-to-deploy data management solution with real-time communication and incentives. Educational Institutions: Complete training lab environment for serverless development, ML, and real-time apps courses. 2. Problem Analysis Current Situation:\nSmall businesses and educational institutions face difficulties managing student data due to lack of infrastructure knowledge, lack of centralized management tools, and high costs of traditional systems such as self-managed servers or on-premise databases. Additionally, the lack of real-time communication features leads to delayed communication, absence of incentive mechanisms like diligence ranking, and manual exam event processing (such as updating scores, exam reminders).\nProposed Solution:\nThe system provides a serverless management system on AWS with capabilities:\nData management: DynamoDB + Lambda handles storage and querying of student information and scores. Secure authentication: Cognito manages login for lecturers and admins. Accessible frontend: S3 + Amplify hosts user-friendly dashboard interface. Monitoring: CloudWatch tracks logs and system performance. Real-time communication: AWS AppSync with GraphQL subscriptions to support real-time chat between students and teachers. Student diligence ranking: AWS Personalize analyzes activity data to re-rank students by diligence level. Automated notifications: AWS SES sends ranking notification emails and system updates. Exam event processing: Amazon EventBridge routes events from management web (such as creating new exams, updating scores) to trigger Lambda automation (e.g., sending notifications, updating rankings). Expected Effectiveness:\nReduce infrastructure costs by 90% compared to traditional servers. Reduce deployment time by 70% with serverless technology. Increase communication efficiency by 60% with real-time chat. Increase engagement by 50% with personalized ratings and notifications.- Enhance cloud skills for students through practical hands-on experience. 3. Solution Architecture The system is designed following the AWS Well-Architected Framework with interconnected layers, ensuring data management capabilities, authentication, monitoring, real-time communication, ML ranking, notifications, and continuous event processing.
